Analysis of Algorithms
Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory.
Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.

Why Analysis of the Algorithm is important?
=> To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on specific systems.
=> It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm since there are too many influencing factors.
=> The analysis is thus only an approximation not perfect.

Types of Algorithm Analysis
1. Best Case
2. Worst Case
3. Average Case


1. Best Case
  
Asymptotic Analysis

=> The idea is to measure the order of growth
=> Does not depend upon the machine, programming language, etc.,
=> No need to implement we can analyze the algorithm.
